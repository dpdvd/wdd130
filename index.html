      <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Hello, my name is Daniel Podvodov" width="200">
      <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Podvodov and I'm from Ukraine. I like swimming, gymnastics, breakdancing, business and learning new skills. My love for learning has been a constant throughout my life, and it remains one of my favorite hobbies to this day. I firmly believe that acquiring useful skills is essential for personal growth and success in life. That is why I am interested in business and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and understanding of diverse skill sets required in the field. I pursued a bachelor's degree in Psychology and currently, I am studying Software Development at Brigham Young University - Idaho. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also taken project management classes and have three months of experience as a scrum master, which has given me valuable leadership and team-building skills. Overall, I am excited about the opportunities that the future holds and look forward to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact.</p>
